See Project-3.pdf in the repository for details.

## Instructions
1. To begin, you need five files (and, of course, ```SVM-p8.py```, ```SVM-e8.py```, ```SVM-p16.py``` and ```SVM-e16.py```):
    ```
    x_test.csv
    y_test.csv
    fraction_xy.py
    requirements.txt
    accuracy_seed_test.py
    ```

2. Get all the required dependencies:
    *Windows*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *macOS/Linux*
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    ```

    *macOS/Linux*
    ```bash
    python3 accuracy_seed_test.py
    ```
